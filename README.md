# ac-turnip-calculator

A simple React application I made to quickly calculate turnip buy price and how much to tip. This is especially useful when I'm travelling to other players' islands (via r/acturnips) to sell my turnips. It's a community custom to always tip when you sell at other peoples' islands, and I find it useful to see at a glance exactly how many bell bags I need to leave for the other player before I leave. This would ultimately save a lot of time, especially since other players coming in and out of the island can delay time on the visiting island significantly.

**This project is still under construction.**

## Features

- Allows for input of the following items:
  - Turnip price
  - Number of turnips (4000, a full inventory of 10x turnips, by default)
  - Tip percentage (Community standard of 10% is set as the default)
- Calculates the following:
  - Amount of bells the Nooklings will pay you for your turnips given the price and quantity
  - Amount of bells to tip the player, given buy price and tip percentage

## Setup

You can run the following to start the server in development mode: (standard CRA setup atm)

```
yarn start
```
